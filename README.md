# Basic-C-Terminal-RPG
When i started programming, i used c/cpp. Someday i found out that C is not the best lang for creating easy graphical applications, so jumped right into ruby, and forgeted about c. Some days ago, i was livestreaming and i did an CLI RPG, just to know if i remember anything from C.
